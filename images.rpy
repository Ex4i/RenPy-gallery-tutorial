# Defining image objects for CGs is optional, but lets you have CGs in full size in your game, and scale them down for a lower resolution. 
# This makes a huge difference when playing fullscreen on an FHD or bigger resolution monitor.
# The names of the defined images must match the filenames if you're using the automatically built thumbnails
